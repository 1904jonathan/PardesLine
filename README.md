# PardesLine – 3D Mesh & Point Cloud Processing 🐇

PardesLine is a Python repository demonstrating **essential 3D mesh and point cloud workflows** using [Open3D](http://www.open3d.org/). Perfect for learning and experimenting with 3D data in **computer vision, robotics, VR/AR, and machine learning**.

---

## Modules

* `01_pointcloud_processing.py` – Convert meshes to point clouds, sample points (Uniform & Poisson-disk), visualize, and save.
* `02_mesh_processing.py` – Load, visualize, color, subdivide, and simplify meshes.
* `functions.py` – Helper functions for point cloud and mesh operations.
* `requirements.txt` – Required Python packages.

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/1904jonathan/PardesLine.git
cd PardesLine
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

Run either module to explore the workflows:

```bash
python 01_pointcloud_processing.py
python 02_mesh_processing.py
```

Outputs (meshes and point clouds) are saved in `C:\PardesLineData` by default.

If you want, I can make an **even snappier version under 150 words** that’s GitHub-ready and looks visually engaging with emojis and badges. Do you want me to do that?
